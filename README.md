# End_to_End_Waste_Detection_Using_Yol0V5
# Results:
- Built an end-to-end object detection system using YOLOv5 for waste classification across 13 material classes.
- Implemented image annotation with Python labeling, created a pipeline to automate data ingestion and validation.
- Trained YOLOv5, set up the pipeline, and built a Flask-based system for image upload, training, and live prediction
- Achieved 94.8% mAP50 and 78.2% mAP50-95 on YOLOv5 across 13 waste material classes.
- Deployed on AWS (EC2, ECR, IAM) using Docker, CI/CD, and GitHub Actions, automating integration and deployment
